# UX Writing Guideline

- Voice (personality): helpful, professional, concise
- Tones (mood) : supportive, clear, neutral
- Target Users: Primarily adult professionals; teachers, developers, and salespeople, who are comfortable with some technical or advanced terms. However, avoid overly complex jargon to ensure clarity and accessibility.
- Use [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) to check if a particular word or phrase is prevalent in the field
